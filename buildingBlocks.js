/*Write a class Block that creates a block (Duh..)
##Requirements
The constructor should take an array as an argument, this will contain 3 integers of the 
form [width, length, height] from which the Block should be created.
Define these methods: 

`getWidth()` return the width of the `Block`

`getLength()` return the length of the `Block`

`getHeight()` return the height of the `Block`

`getVolume()` return the volume of the `Block`

`getSurfaceArea()` return the surface area of the `Block`

    console.log(data);
